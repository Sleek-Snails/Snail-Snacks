# Python Discord Code Jam Sleek Snails

## Install & Running Instructions

1. `git clone https://github.com/Sleek-Snails/Snail-Snacks.git`
2. `cd Snail-Snacks`
3. `pip install -r dev-requirements.txt`
4. `cd code`
5. `python MainMenu.py`


## Setup Dev enviroment

#### Download Repository & Switch into directory
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/Sleek-Snails/Snail-Snacks.git
$ cd Snail-Snacks
```

#### Installing/Updating virtualenv
```shell
$ pip install virtualenv
```

#### Creating the environment
Create a virtual environment in the folder `.venv`.
```shell
$ python -m venv .venv
```

#### Enter the environment
It will change based on your operating system and shell.
```shell
# MacOS, zsh
$ source .venv/bin/activate
# Linux, Bash
$ source .venv/bin/activate
# Linux, Fish
$ source .venv/bin/activate.fish
# Linux, Csh
$ source .venv/bin/activate.csh
# Linux, PowerShell Core
$ .venv/bin/Activate.ps1
# Windows, cmd.exe
> .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
# Windows, PowerShell
> .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

#### Installing the Dependencies
Once the environment is created and activated, use this command to install the development dependencies.
```shell
$ pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
```

#### Enable pre-commit hook
```shell
$ pre-commit install
```

#### Exiting the environment
Interestingly enough, it is the same for every platform
```shell
$ deactivate
```

## Lint Stuff

### flake8: general style rules

Our first and probably most important tool is flake8. It will run a set of plugins on your codebase and warn you about any non-conforming lines.
Here is a sample output:
```
~> flake8
./app.py:1:1: D100 Missing docstring in public module
./app.py:1:6: N802 function name 'helloWorld' should be lowercase
./app.py:1:16: E201 whitespace after '('
./app.py:1:17: ANN001 Missing type annotation for function argument 'name'
./app.py:1:23: ANN201 Missing return type annotation for public function
./app.py:2:1: D400 First line should end with a period
./app.py:2:1: D403 First word of the first line should be properly capitalized
./app.py:3:19: E225 missing whitespace around operator
```

Each line corresponds to an error. The first part is the file path, then the line number, and the column index.
Then comes the error code, a unique identifier of the error, and then a human-readable message.

If, for any reason, you do not wish to comply with this specific error on a specific line, you can add `# noqa: CODE` at the end of the line.
For example:
```python
def helloWorld():  # noqa: N802
    ...
```
will pass linting. Although we do not recommend ignoring errors unless you have a good reason to do so.

It is run by calling `flake8` in the project root.


#### Plugin List:

- `flake8-annotations`: Checks your code for the presence of [type-hints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html).
- `flake8-bandit`: Checks for common security breaches.
- `flake8-docstring`: Checks that you properly documented your code.
- `flake8-isort`: Makes sure you ran ISort on the project.

### ISort: automatic import sorting

This second tool will sort your imports according to the [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#imports). That's it! One less thing for you to do!

It is run by calling `isort .` in the project root. Notice the dot at the end, it tells ISort to use the current directory.

### Pre-commit: run linting before committing

This third tool doesn't check your code, but rather makes sure that you actually *do* check it.

It makes use of a feature called [Git hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks) which allow you to run a piece of code before running `git commit`.
The good thing about it is that it will cancel your commit if the lint doesn't pass. You won't have to wait for Github Actions to report and have a second fix commit.

It is *installed* by running `pre-commit install` and can be run manually by calling only `pre-commit`.

[Lint before you push!](https://soundcloud.com/lemonsaurusrex/lint-before-you-push)

#### Hooks List:

- `check-toml`: Lints and corrects your TOML files.
- `check-yaml`: Lints and corrects your YAML files.
- `end-of-file-fixer`: Makes sure you always have an empty line at the end of your file.
- `trailing-whitespaces`: Removes whitespaces at the end of each line.
- `python-check-blanket-noqa`: Forbids you from using noqas on large pieces of code.
- `isort`: Runs ISort.
- `flake8`: Runs flake8.

The last two hooks won't ship with their own environment but will rather run shell commands. You will have to modify them if you change your dependency manager.
